            <h1>Profile</h1>
            <p>It was in the deepest reaches of her dreams that she would always see that girl's tragic, fragmented memories. 
                She would look away, close her eyes, run with all her might, but all this only deepened the sneer that the other presence within her wore. 
                Now, she has decided to face everything head-on, to accept who she is, to bear the heavy burden of the past. 
                This road is destined to be a thorny one, but the will that she carries shall also become the flame with which she shall carve the way forward open.</p>
